bapq_d_instructions,bapq,"The Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire",descriptive,"Instructions You are about to fill out a series of statements related to personality and lifestyle. For each question, select the answer that best describes how often that statement applies to you. Many of these questions ask about your interactions with other people. Please think about the way you are with most people, rather than special relationships you may have with spouses or significant others, children, siblings, and parents. Everyone changes over time, which can make it hard to fill out questions about personality. Think about the way you have been the majority of your adult life, rather than the way you were as a teenager, or times you may have felt different than normal. You must answer each question, and give only one answer per question. If you are confused, please give your best guess.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
